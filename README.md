1. An Open Source Ticker, easy to use and accessable

We urgently need it for our next hitchhiking race and i also want to include something like this in my blog to give short life-signs from the road while going around the world. Target group hitchhikers, for sure. 

It should be easy to integrate into websites and blogs. For example: I am totally n00b with every web developing shit. I am kind of pre-enduser that likes to register somewhere, put a widget/code on my website and use the App.

2. Online and SMS

Everything is about Internet today. But on the road you wont have internet all the time. especially when we race in some abandoned area. So an SMS feature is needed. Text and (maybe) pictures.

3. Keep it simple but expandable

Keep it simple, make it going and then add things if needed. I appreciate this.
